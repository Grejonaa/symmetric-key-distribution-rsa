# Symmetric Key Distribution Using RSA

## Project Overview

This project implements a secure communication system using a **hybrid encryption approach**:

*  **RSA (Asymmetric Encryption)** → used to securely exchange a symmetric key
*  **Symmetric Encryption** → used to encrypt and decrypt messages

The system follows a **client-server model**, where the server acts as a trusted authority that distributes encrypted symmetric keys to clients.
The system logs all major events such as key generation, encryption, decryption, and communication between client and server.
The client application includes comprehensive logging and error handling mechanisms for:
- JSON communication errors
- Encryption/decryption failures
- Connection interruptions
- Invalid server responses
The application uses rotating log files to improve maintainability and prevent unlimited log growth.
The client validates AES key lengths before encryption to ensure compliance with AES standards.

## Objectives

* Understand how **RSA** is used for secure key exchange
* Learn how **symmetric encryption** works in real communication
* Simulate a secure client-server communication system
* Apply best practices in cryptography and software structure

---

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* `cryptography` library (for RSA & symmetric encryption)
* Sockets (for client-server communication)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Grejonaa/symmetric-key-distribution-rsa.git
cd symmetric-key-distribution-rsa
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## How to Run

### Start the server:

```
python server/server.py
```

### Start the client:

```
python client/client.py
```

---

## How It Works

1. Client sends a request to the server
2. Server generates a **symmetric key**
3. Server encrypts the key using **RSA public key**
4. Client decrypts it using **RSA private key**
5. Client and server use the symmetric key for secure communication

---

## Example Workflow

Client:

```
Requesting symmetric key...
Key received and decrypted successfully.
Enter message:
> Hello secure world
```

Server:

```
Client connected...
Encrypted symmetric key sent.
Message received and decrypted successfully.
```
